Do Now:
    1. Manage Juridictions and delete jurisdictions.
    2. Move business logic in processors to api. keep out of interface.
    3. User summary email. Create console service for this. 


For Later:
    1. Switch db service to sql server instead of postgres.
    2. When IT sets up a internal email, setup that instead of gmail.
    3. create encryptor for password, so they wont be exposed in AppSettings.
    4. Admin reporting for Jess "Will it track length of ticket before closure? 
                                 Number of tickets per individual?  
                                 Number of tickets per agency?"
